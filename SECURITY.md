# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This repository contains solutions for Advent of Code 2025. As this is a personal project for educational purposes, there is no formal versioning or long-term support cycle. The code is provided "as is".

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability within this repository, please report it by creating a GitHub Issue.

Since this code is intended to be run locally for solving puzzles and not deployed as a service, the risk surface is minimal. However, I appreciate any feedback regarding potential security improvements in the code (e.g., buffer overflows in C/C++ solutions).

1.  **Open an Issue**: Describe the vulnerability and provide a reproduction case if possible.
2.  **Response**: I will review the issue as soon as possible.
3.  **Fix**: If valid, I will apply a fix and close the issue.

Thank you for helping improve the quality of this code!
